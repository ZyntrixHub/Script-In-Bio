Hello Thank so much for using my script here is a tutorial to use it
Step 1 Copy the script then paste it to ur executor 
Step 2 u would need this following pets in order for the script to work Raccoons,DragonFlys,Red Foxes,Polar Bears,Panda,Queen bee,Chicken zombie,Disco bee,Butterfly,Mimic octopus,seal,and more
Step 3 if u have does pets then u wouldneed to wait now for 5-10 minutes for the script to load
